Build, fit, and apply telescope pointing models using standard equatorial and harmonic terms. Interactive REPL with TPOINT-compatible workflow: load observations, fit models via least-squares, analyze residuals with plots, and export corrections. No runtime FFI.

## Installation

```toml
[dependencies]
cosmos-pointing = "0.1"
```

Or run the interactive CLI:

```bash
cargo install cosmos-pointing
pointing
```

## Pointing Terms

| Category  | Terms                                                        |

## Example Session

```sh
pointing> INDAT observations.dat
Loaded 47 observations
pointing> USE IH ID CH NP MA ME
6 terms active
pointing> FIT
RMS = 4.23"  (was 127.8")
pointing> OPTIMAL
Base: IH ID CH NP MA ME (BIC=312.4, RMS=4.23")
+ TF (dBIC=-18.2, RMS=3.41")
+ HHSH (dBIC=-7.1, RMS=3.12")
Final model: 8 terms, RMS=3.12"
pointing> GSCAT residuals.svg
Written to residuals.svg
pointing> OUTMOD model.dat
```

## Commands

| Command   | Purpose                                      |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------|
| `INDAT`   | Load observation data file                   |
| `USE`     | Add terms to active model                    |
| `FIT`     | Fit model to observations                    |
| `SHOW`    | Display current model coefficients           |
| `OPTIMAL` | Auto-build model using BIC selection         |
| `OUTMOD`  | Export model coefficients                    |
| `CORRECT` | Compute correction for target coordinates    |
| `PREDICT` | Show per-term correction breakdown           |
| `GSCAT`   | Scatter plot (dX vs dDec)                    |
| `GDIST`   | Histogram of residual distributions          |
| `GMAP`    | Sky map with residual vectors                |
| `GHA`     | Residuals vs hour angle                      |
| `GDEC`    | Residuals vs declination                     |
| `GHYST`   | Hysteresis plot by pier side                 |

## Design Notes

- **OPTIMAL uses BIC**: Forward stepwise selection with Bayesian Information Criterion prevents overfitting. Terms must improve BIC by at least -6.0 to be added.
- **Parallel harmonic search**: Candidate evaluation uses rayon for fast model selection across 96 harmonic terms.
- **Dual output modes**: All plot commands support terminal ASCII (no args) or SVG file output (with path argument).
- **Pier-side aware**: Observations track East/West pier side for hysteresis analysis on German equatorial mounts.
